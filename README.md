# auto_mkdir
Just a very simple automatization for creating folders :)

To use it:

<b> chmod +x folder.sh </b>

# <i> For more comfort: </i>

 mv folder.sh /usr/bin/folder.sh

<b> Append the following to your ~/.bashrc file: </b>

alias folder="source /usr/bin/folder.sh"

<b> And then: </b>

source  ~/.bashrc 

Note: Your current shell may not be bash, in that case change the ~/.bashrc file for the one of the shell you are using.
i.e, I'm using zsh so i make the edit in the ~/.zshrc file.
